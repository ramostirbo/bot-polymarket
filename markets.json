Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%, 0.6%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.5%, the market will resolve to “Yes”, if it is 0.4%, this market will resolve to “No”).",

      "question": "Will 'Avatar: The Way of Water' gross more than $175 million domestically on its opening weekend?",
      "description": "'Avatar: The Way of Water' (2022) is an upcoming American action adventure fantasy sci-fi film produced by 20th Century Studios. It is the second installment of the Avatar film series directed by James Cameron. It is scheduled for theatrical release in the USA on December 16, 2022.\n\nThis is a market on how much ‘Avatar: The Way of Water' will gross domestically on its opening weekend. The “Domestic Weekend” tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt1630029/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (Dec 16-18) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if ‘Avatar: The Way of Water’ grosses more than $175,000,000 on its opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by December 26, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n",

      "description": "On March 14, 2022, Do Kwon (@stablekwon) and Sensei Algod (@AlgodTrading) made a bet on whether the price of Terra (LUNA) would be lower on March 14, 2023 than it was on March 14, 2022. \n\nEach party put up 1 million, to an escrow wallet owned by @cobie. Do Kwon bet LUNA would be $92.40 or higher on March 14, 2023, and Sensei Algod bet LUNA would be lower than $92.40.\n\nThis market will resolve to “Do Kwon” if Do Kwon wins the bet, or “Sensei Algod” if Sensei Algod wins the bet.\n\nIf for whatever reason the winner of the bet isn’t decided by April 1, 2023, or is ambiguous (e.g. the result isn't agreed to by both parties and @cobie), LUNA’s 24h average price on March 14, 2023, ET will be checked. If it is 92.40$ or above, the market will resolve to “Do Kwon”, otherwise it will resolve to “Sensei Algod”.\n\nThe 24h price will be calculated from Coingecko (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/terra-luna), by averaging the close price of all forty-eight 30 minute candles for the timeframe March 14 12:00:00 AM ET to March 15 12:00:00 AM ET.

      "question": "Will Joe Biden's FiveThirtyEight approval rating be 43.3% or higher on January 7?",
      "description": "This market will resolve to “Yes” if Joe Biden's approval rating as reported by FiveThirtyEight will be greater than or equal to 43.3% for the day of January 7, 2023. Otherwise, this market will resolve to “No”. \n\nThe resolution source will be FiveThirtyEight's approval rating poll aggregator, https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/, specifically the approval rating indicated by the green trend line for the resolution date. Changes in the methodology by which FiveThirtyEight calculates the approval rating will have no bearing on the resolution of this market. \n\nThe resolution data for January 7 will be checked on January 8, 2023 (12 PM ET), and can only resolve after the check. If for any reason (e.g. error, no data taken, etc.) there is no data point for January 7 on the check time, the market will be checked 6 hours later, at 6 PM ET on January 8, 2023. If there is still no data point, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to January 7. \n\nIf Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to January 7. Please note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by March 13, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n",

      "description": "This is a market on a month-to-month inflation, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPI-U), from November to December 2022. \n\nInflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n\nThis market will resolve to “Yes” if the index increased by more than -0.1 percent (on a seasonally adjusted basis) from November to December 2022 and “No“ otherwise. \n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS December 2022 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled to be released on January 12, 2023, at 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data. \n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. \n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%, 0.6%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is -0.1%, the market will resolve to “No”, if it is 0.0%, this market will resolve to “Yes”).\n",

It follows the exploits of a series of unlikely characters who end up in a forest with a bear who unintentionally ingested a large amount of cocaine. It is scheduled for theatrical release in the USA on February 24, 2023.\n\nThis is a market on how much ‘Cocaine Bear' will gross domestically on its opening weekend. The “Domestic Weekend” tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt14209916/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (Feb 24-26) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if ‘Cocaine Bear’ grosses more than $20,000,000 on its opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by March 13, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n",

Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%, 0.6%, etc).

Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%, 0.6%, etc).

Empirically speaking, having a live token will be considered fulfilled if official project channels announce the introduction of the token and it is live on mainnet, and swappable and acquirable (i.e. via Uniswap). In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or “live”, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not “live” and thus will not satisfy market conditions.

The primary resolution source for this settlement criterion will be official information released by Binance, official representatives of Binance (e.g. lawyers, spokespeople, etc.), and a consensus of credible reporting. \n\nIf neither of the above criteria are met, this market will resolve to \"No\". \n\nThis market only concerns Binance.com. Binance.us is not considered for this market. \n\nBinance.com withdrawals being suspended for a majority of users means that a majority of users are unable to withdraw their BTC and/or ETH from Binance (E.g. If a majority of users are unable to withdraw their ETH from Binance, it will satisfy the condition.)\n\nIf Binance.com suspends withdrawals on a day in the last week of January (e.g. They halt token withdrawals on January 30, 2023, 4 PM ET), this market will not resolve until either: 1) withdrawals are reenabled before 7 full days (168 hours) pass, resulting in a \"No\" resolution; 2) 7 full days pass (Jan 30 - Feb 6, 2023, 4 PM ET) where withdrawals are suspended, resulting in a \"Yes\" resolution.",

      "question": "Will 'Cocaine Bear' gross more than $12 million domestically on opening weekend?",
      "description": "'Cocaine Bear' (2023) is an upcoming American thriller film produced by Universal Pictures. It follows the exploits of a series of unlikely characters who end up in a forest with a bear who unintentionally ingested a large amount of cocaine. It is scheduled for theatrical release in the USA on February 24, 2023.\n\nThis is a market on how much ‘Cocaine Bear' will gross domestically on its opening weekend. The “Domestic Weekend” tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt14209916/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (Feb 24-26) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if ‘Cocaine Bear’ grosses more than $12,000,000 on its opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by March 13, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n",

The outcome will be corroborated by examining SpaceX’s official video feed of the launch (https://www.youtube.com/c/SpaceX), as well as secondary video feeds or written reports if necessary.\n\nIf the Starship completes a successful launch by March 31 2023, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to “Yes”.
